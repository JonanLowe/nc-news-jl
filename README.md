# Northcoders News API

Dear developer,

In order to succesfully connect your databases locally, you will need to add the following 2 files to the root directoy:

.env.test
.env.dev

---

.env.test should set PGDATABASE to equal the correct test database.
.env.news should set PGDATABASE to equal the correct development database.

For details of the required databases, please contact Jon Lowe.
